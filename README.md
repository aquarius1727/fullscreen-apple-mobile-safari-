# fullscreen-apple-mobile-safari-

I'm developing a web-based presentation
So i come up with this one
But but but but
Its not working on some apple devices and ios
I think its on iframe issue with the touchscreen and etc...


Here's how it works:

a) Open the file on safari
b) Add to Homescreen
c) then open it from home screen


This code makes it fullscreen on webkit (this one works on android too i tried it once)
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">

Check out the code...

Thanks!
